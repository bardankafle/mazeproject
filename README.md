# Maze Project

This project is a Python implementation of a text-based maze game. The game utilizes map files to generate the maze, and the player must navigate through the maze to find the exit while avoiding obstacles such as locked doors. Locked doors can be opened using pickups that are scattered around the maze. This project was written at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
